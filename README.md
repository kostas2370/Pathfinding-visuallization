# Pathfinding App

The Pathfinding App is a tool for visualizing the pathfinding algorithms of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) on a grid.

## Features

-   Allows users to select the starting and ending points on the grid
-   Implements BFS and DFS algorithms to find the shortest path between the start and end points
-   Displays the path and the number of steps taken by the algorithm
-   Provides options to visualize the grid, the visited cells, and the path

## Requirements

-   Python 3.x
-   Pygame library

## Usage

1.  Download the code from the repository
2.  Run the app by executing **python ui.py** in the command line
3.  Select the starting and ending points on the grid by clicking on the cells
4.  Choose the algorithm (BFS or DFS) and press start
5.  Observe the path taken by the algorithm

The app is user-friendly and easy to use. Feel free to customize it to suit your needs.
